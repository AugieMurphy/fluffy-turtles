That's strange... \n
I've never seen you before. \n
Where you in that shipwreck last night? \n
I hope you have another boat,
nobody's left this island in years. \n
BUT... maybe I can help you!
Complete these quests and then come find me.
I'll get you off the island.

Did you just ask me where the village is? \n
Well, the old village is to the right, 
where it's always been.
But, nobody's been there in years. \n
The Medicine man?
OH!!! You mean the new village.
That's straight ahead.
But be wary, there's pirates about.
Take this to protect yourself.
