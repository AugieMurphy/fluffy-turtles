* Which jobs are most crucial?
        Making sure that both quests and the world work. Without either of these working, the game will not even be playable.
        On this note, graphics must be kept simple.
* Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
        Core functionality: Locations, Quest, and interaction between player and other things.
Non-essential: good graphics and shapes
* Which components are prerequisites for others?
        The quest must work for the quest stack to work, and vice versa. Location must work for path to work and for WorldMap to work.
* Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
At this rate, most of the work can be independently tackled So long as we all know what the other is working on and catch up every now and again.
* What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
At this rate, it should be all working in due time - we plan to have everything up to step 4 working by friday.
