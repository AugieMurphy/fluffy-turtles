# __Lost Island Adventure__

## Description
OH, NO!!! You have been shipwrecked on a mysterious island! Our point-and-click adventure game presents you with your first quest: find shelter. Search the island and see if there are any inhabitants or if you're truly alone. Then, try to survive or build a ship to return home.

The User can interact with different objects in the game by clicking on them. Tools will be added to their inventory.

## How it Works
The locations are connected by a WORLDMAP-- which is basically just a fancy name for a graph. There's a series of nodes (LOCATIONS) and they are linked by PATHS/EXITS. 

The story/scripted events are popped from a stack, as are the QUESTS. In this way, no matter what choices the user makes they are eventually guided down the correct path.
